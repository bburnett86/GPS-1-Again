Before the GPS session I was really struggling with merging files. I'd learned a pretty simple way to merge files from my classes before, but it wouldn't work in this situation. The way I learned how ot merge would only be successful with a bunch of people working on different aspects of a website. This version of merging is more successful for this experience because it allows two people to merge the same documents. Admittedly this is something I struggle with, but I would like to think that I'll figure this out as time goes on.

During my GPS collaboratively we clarified commit. And understanding commit and how it relates to not only being able to save your files but revisit them was definitely priceless. Commit gives you the ability to essentially take a snapshot of what you're currently working on and come back to it later.

The guide and I got an early start because my partner was a little behind. I mostly asked him questions about DBC and my future GPS adventures. My classmate was also a wealth of knowledge and very helpful in terms of operating everything. My partner was a much better driver than I.

I'm still confused about merging. I'm also a bit confused about how repositories work. I more or less lost access to mine. I'm not sure how it happened, but it comes across as a black box that isn't an active link.

My first pairing experience was great. My partner was nice, the guide was informative and we got our work done even after the original time for the session was over.
